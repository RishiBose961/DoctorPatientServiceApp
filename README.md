# DoctorPatientServiceApp

## Inspiration
The idea of creating a web app that interacts with patients and doctors come from the lack of online communication tools between patients and doctors. When we look for illness related information and cannot find them online, a website like this would be a perfect platform for us to ask any illness related questions.

## What it does
It provides a blog-style website that allows patients and doctors to communicate, specifically patients can post their questions on the website and doctors are able to answer down the post comments. However, everyone including patients are encouraged to comment under the posts.

## How we built it
We used React framework for building the frontend UI, and we implemented MongoDB for data storage and as well as Firebase for cloud storage. 

## Challenges we ran into
Having teammates from opposite sides of the world, timezone was a great concern. Some of us have to work alone for nearly half of the time when others are asleep. This impacts communication and slows down our progress. Also, some teammates aren't very caught up with technologies used in this project, and so others have to undertake more workload.

## What's next for Doctor Patient Service App
Get some actual doctors! Some of our teammates have connections with friends who's family members are doctors. If we keep updating features and details and host it online, we can discuss it with a few doctors that we can get in touch with and hopefully they are willing to partake in this wonderful idea!
